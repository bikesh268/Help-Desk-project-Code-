        <span class="subTitleFont">Automated Help Desks - Knowledge Management</span>
        <span class="textFont">It is no secret that the pressure is on as far as help 
                        desks are concerned. Growing product lines, products that are only on the market 
                        for a short while, keeping a help desk updated and current on all of the 
                        multitudinous varieties of problems that can occur is nearly impossible. Most of 
                        the high tech products that are currently being marketed have been available for 
                        less than a year. That statistic alone successfully illustrates the difficulties 
                        that help desks are facing, not even taking into account the increasing 
                        complexity of those products.
                        <br />
        <br />Some experts say that the only answer available is automation. The help desk 
                        must be automated to have any prayer of keeping current and making the right 
                        information available both to staff and consumers, and there are a number of 
                        ways of doing that.
                        <br />
        <br />One of the simplest is to publish existing information on the corporate website 
                        which makes certain that competent answers to frequently asked questions are 
                        available. It is low cost and always available, but it is limited to the 
                        information that has been input on the web and is not automatically updated. The 
                        same thing is true of publishing customer query responses on the website and 
                        allowing customers to use a keyword driven search engine to find what they need.
                        <br />
        <br />On the other hand, natural language processing and contextual awareness tools 
                        are vastly different. Natural language processing is quite accurate at 
                        determining meaning and locating relevant documents when customers ask their 
                        questions verbally. That sounds low, but when compared with the much lower 
                        probability that a customer will find what they are seeking via a keyword 
                        search, it sounds better.
                        <br />
        <br />Context is taken into account with natural language processing, which means that 
                        the software can operate in the presence of some language errors. It is equipped 
                        with dictionaries, idiom dictionaries, and thesauruses and is able for form 
                        relationships within documents, generating patterns from them that can be 
                        matched to patterns in customer queries.
                        <br />
        <br />Customers often have frustrating experiences with self-help solutions. That 
                        occurs because they have not found the information they wanted through a keyword 
                        search or that they have not expressed the problem well enough for the software 
                        solution to identify what they want. Vendors are making efforts to improve the 
                        process to keep customers happy. Customers are asked each time they get a 
                        response, for example, if the question was answered and how well it was 
                        answered. Some software lets users log the fact that a solution was not found 
                        and when a solution is found, the help desk emails it to the customer. 
                        Similarly, when a problem is reported by one customer that could potentially 
                        impact others, the software automatically emails all other customers who might 
                        experience the same difficulty.
                        <br />
        <br />Automatic help desk solutions provide front line support and help keep costs 
                        down. This is particularly true in high tech companies that are growing 
                        exponentially. It is also true that these types of solutions work even better 
                        with technical customers who can express their queries in the appropriate terms 
                        and who are already adept at solving their own problems. The use of natural 
                        language processing and self-learning techniques are rapidly improving the 
                        process. </span>
